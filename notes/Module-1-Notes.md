# Module 1 : Get Started with Power BI

*Learning Path: Get started with Microsoft data analytics*  
*Focus: Introduction to Power BI, its components, flow, and building blocks*

---

## Learning Objectives
By the end of this module, I can:
- Explain how Power BI services and applications work together
- Explore how Power BI can improve business efficiency
- Create compelling visuals and reports

---

## Introduction
Power BI is a complete reporting solution that covers:
- **Data preparation**
- **Data visualization**
- **Distribution and management**

It scales from simple single‑source reports to complex semantic models.  
Power BI is essential for data analysts, but valuable for all professionals who need to explore and present insights.

---

## Components of Power BI
- **Power BI Desktop** → Development tool for creating reports and semantic models  
- **Power BI Service** → Online platform for publishing, managing, and distributing reports  
- **Power BI Mobile** → Mobile app for consuming reports in optimized layouts  

👉 Typical flow: Build in Desktop → Publish to Service → Consume via Service/Mobile.

---

## Flow of Power BI
1. Connect to data (Desktop)
2. Transform data with Power Query
3. Model relationships & calculations
4. Create visualizations and reports
5. Publish to Power BI Service
6. Distribute and manage reports/dashboards

---

## Building Blocks
- **Semantic Models** → Data sources, transformations, relationships, calculations  
- **Visualizations** → Charts, tables, KPIs, interactive visuals  

Reports = semantic model + visuals.  
Dashboards = pinned visuals from reports (high‑level, single page).

---

## Dashboards
- Built in Power BI Service after publishing reports
- Consist of **tiles** pinned from visuals
- Provide high‑level overview; tiles link back to detailed reports

---

## Power BI Service Features
- **Workspaces** → Organize reports and dashboards; share with teams  
- **Apps** → Bundle reports/dashboards for simplified distribution  
- **Template Apps** → Prebuilt solutions (e.g., GitHub, Retail Analysis) that connect to your data  
- **Scheduled Refreshes** → Keep semantic models up to date automatically

---

## Knowledge Check (self‑test)
- What’s the common flow of activity in Power BI?  
- What are the building blocks of Power BI?  
- What is a collection of reports and dashboards called?

---

## My Reflections
- The **Desktop → Service → Mobile flow** mirrors how I used to manage construction dashboards: build centrally, distribute widely.  
- The concept of **semantic models** feels very similar to **SQL schema design** — my database background gives me an edge here.  
- I like how **dashboards** are positioned as “high‑level summaries,” just like project dashboards I used to present to stakeholders.  
- The **apps feature** reminds me of packaging deliverables for different audiences — a skill I can leverage in IT consulting.  
- This module sets the foundation: I see Power BI as both a **technical tool** and a **communication platform** for decision‑making.

---

## Summary
- Power BI = Desktop + Service + Mobile  
- Building blocks = Semantic models + Visualizations  
- Dashboards + Apps = Distribution and collaboration  
- Enables data‑driven decisions across organizations
