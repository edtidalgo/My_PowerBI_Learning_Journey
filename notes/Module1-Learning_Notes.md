# Learning Notes

## Module: Get started building with Power BI
*Duration: 21 min | 6 Units*

### Learning Objectives
- Understand how Power BI services and applications work together
- Explore how Power BI can make business more efficient
- Create compelling visuals and reports

---

## 1. Introduction
Power BI is a complete reporting solution for:
- Data preparation
- Data visualization
- Distribution and management

It scales from simple single-source reports to complex semantic models.

---

## 2. Components of Power BI
- **Power BI Desktop** → Create reports, semantic models, transformations
- **Power BI Service** → Publish, manage, distribute, build dashboards
- **Power BI Mobile** → View reports in mobile-optimized format

---

## 3. Flow of Power BI
1. Connect to data (Desktop)
2. Transform with Power Query
3. Model relationships & calculations
4. Build visuals & reports
5. Publish to Service
6. Distribute via dashboards & apps

---

## 4. Building Blocks
- **Semantic Models**: Data sources, transformations, relationships, calculations
- **Visualizations**: Charts, tables, KPIs, interactive visuals

---

## 5. Dashboards
- Single-page, high-level view
- Built by pinning visuals from reports
- Tiles link back to detailed reports

---

## 6. Power BI Service
- Organize with **Workspaces**
- Share via **Apps**
- Use **Template Apps** (e.g., GitHub, Retail Analysis)
- Configure **Scheduled Refreshes**

---

## Knowledge Check
- Flow: Desktop → Service → Mobile
- Building blocks: Semantic models + Visualizations
- Collection of reports/dashboards = App

---

## Summary
Power BI = Desktop + Service + Mobile  
Semantic models + Visualizations = foundation  
Dashboards + Apps = distribution

## Reflections
- “I found the semantic model concept similar to SQL schema design.”
- “Dashboards remind me of construction project dashboards I used to manage.”
